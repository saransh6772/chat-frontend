# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



the admin page can be accessed by going to https://saransh-parikh-chat-app.vercel.app/admin
the admin key is "riubviejbvibenrvibrei." since the admin page doesn't have anything that can update or delete anything, I thought it would be okay if I gave out the admin key.
